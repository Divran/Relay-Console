# Relay Console
### Introduction
Relay console allows server administrators to remotely view and interact with the server console.

## Usage

The console opens when the standard ingame console is opened. By default all users in the group "owner" have full access to the console. 

### ULX
If you have ulx installed, all admins can see the console, superadmins can access the rcon tab and run serverside errors.
The [ulx group permissions menu](https://hostr.co/spJgT4MnCrbg) or the corresponding console commands can be used to add more finegrained control through the following permissions:
- relayc show
- relayc spew
- relayc rcon
- relayc luasv
- relayc sverrors
- relayc clerrors

## Requirements
- Optional, to view errors: [gm_luaerror2](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1252625)
